# Deploying nthlayer-core

> Core-only deployment guide for evaluators. Workers and bench have their own surfaces.

## Tutorial: zero to first verdict

This tutorial takes you from a fresh machine to a running `nthlayer-core`
server that has accepted and returned its first verdict. Plan on under
fifteen minutes. Every command below has been executed end-to-end; the
output shown is what you should see.

### 1. Install uv

`nthlayer-core` is distributed on PyPI; this tutorial uses
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Follow the upstream install instructions:
<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>. Any recent
`uv` (≥ 0.5) will work.

### 2. Install nthlayer-core

```bash
uv tool install nthlayer-core
```

Verify the install:

```bash
nthlayer --version
```

```
nthlayer X.Y.Z
```

### 3. Choose a manifests directory

`nthlayer-core` serves a read-only catalogue of OpenSRM service
manifests from a directory you point it at. For this tutorial you have
two options.

**Option A — use the OpenSRM examples.** Clone the spec repo and
point the server at its `examples/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsionnach/opensrm
cd opensrm
```

You will use `opensrm/examples/` as your manifests directory in
step 4.

**Option B — start empty.** An empty directory is valid; the server
starts, accepts and returns verdicts, and `GET /manifests` simply
returns an empty list.

```bash
mkdir empty-dir
```

This tutorial uses Option A from here on (Option B users substitute
`./empty-dir` for `./examples` in step 4).

### 4. Start the server

From inside the `opensrm/` directory:

```bash
NTHLAYER_MANIFESTS_DIR=./examples nthlayer serve
```

You should see the server come up on port 8000:

```
INFO:     Started server process [<pid>]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The server is ready when you see `Application startup complete.`

> The server binds to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces); `localhost:8000` reaches it.

Leave the server running and open a second terminal for the next
steps.

### 5. Health check

```bash
curl localhost:8000/health
```

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

### 6. Post a verdict

A verdict is the unit of recorded outcome in NthLayer. `POST /verdicts`
requires `id`, `type`, and `created_at`. Adding `service` and `outcome`
makes the verdict useful to a worker downstream.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/verdicts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "verdict-001",
    "type": "verdict.created",
    "created_at": "2026-06-16T12:00:00Z",
    "service": "demo-service",
    "outcome": {"status": "pass"}
  }'
```

```json
{"id":"verdict-001"}
```

### 7. Fetch the verdict by id

```bash
curl localhost:8000/verdicts/verdict-001
```

```json
{"id":"verdict-001","type":"verdict.created","created_at":"2026-06-16T12:00:00Z","service":"demo-service","outcome":{"status":"pass"}}
```

### 8. List all verdicts

```bash
curl localhost:8000/verdicts
```

```json
[{"id":"verdict-001","type":"verdict.created","created_at":"2026-06-16T12:00:00Z","service":"demo-service","outcome":{"status":"pass"}}]
```

You now have a `nthlayer-core` server running on `localhost:8000`
that has stored, returned, and listed a verdict. From here you can
wire in a worker (see `nthlayer-workers`) or explore the rest of the
API surface via the OpenAPI spec at `GET /openapi.json`.

## Reference

### CLI

```
nthlayer serve [--host HOST] [--port PORT]   # defaults 0.0.0.0:8000
nthlayer --version                            # also -V
```

The CLI surface is intentionally minimal: one subcommand (`serve`) with
two flags (`--host`, `--port`) plus a top-level `--version`. The store
path and manifests directory are configured via environment variables
rather than flags by design — they are deployment-environment concerns
(filesystem layout, persistent volumes), not per-invocation choices.
See Environment variables below.

### Environment variables

| Env var | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH` | SQLite database path | `nthlayer.db` (cwd-relative) |
| `NTHLAYER_MANIFESTS_DIR` | Directory of OpenSRM YAML manifests | unset (catalogue empty) |

**`NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH`** — when unset, the server opens `nthlayer.db`
in the process's current working directory and SQLite's WAL mode adds
`nthlayer.db-wal` and `nthlayer.db-shm` alongside it. Relative paths
resolve against the server's cwd at startup, not the cwd at install
time or the path of the `uv tool` shim, so a process supervisor that
chdirs before `exec` will land the database in that target directory.
The path requires read and write access; when unset or relative the
containing directory must also be writable so SQLite can create the
WAL and shared-memory sidecar files. A server started from a read-only
directory will appear to start cleanly and then fail on the first
write request (see Troubleshooting).

**`NTHLAYER_MANIFESTS_DIR`** — when unset, the catalogue initialises
empty and `GET /manifests` returns `[]`; verdict, case, and assessment
endpoints still function normally. Relative paths resolve against the
server's cwd at startup. The path requires read access on the
directory and on every `*.yaml` and `*.yml` file inside it. An empty
directory is a valid configuration — the server starts, the catalogue
is empty, and verdicts continue to be accepted and returned. A path
that does not exist or is not a directory is treated the same as
unset: the catalogue is empty and no error is raised at startup.

### Manifests directory layout

The catalogue loads every file matching `*.yaml` or `*.yml` at the top
level of `NTHLAYER_MANIFESTS_DIR`. The loader does not recurse into
subdirectories — files under nested folders are ignored. Convention is
one service per file, named after the service. Each file is parsed as
an OpenSRM reliability manifest; the service name comes from the
manifest's `name` field, not the filename.

Sample manifests live in the OpenSRM examples directory:
<https://github.com/rsionnach/opensrm/tree/main/examples>.

After editing files in the manifests directory, trigger a hot reload
with `POST /manifests/-/reload`. The server picks up new, changed, and
deleted files without a restart and returns a JSON object with the
changed service names under `changed` and the resulting catalogue size
under `total`.

For manifest schema and authoring guidance, see the manifest authoring
guide (forthcoming).

### Troubleshooting

Seven failure modes account for nearly every fresh-machine deployment
problem. Table summarises symptoms; paragraphs below give the diagnosis.

| # | Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `nthlayer: command not found` after install | uv tool-shim dir not on `PATH` | `uv tool update-shell` (or add `~/.local/bin` to `PATH`) |
| 2 | `OSError: [Errno 48/98] Address already in use` | Port 8000 taken | `nthlayer serve --port 8001` or kill the prior process |
| 3 | `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file` | Cwd not writable, or `NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH` points at a missing dir | `NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH=/var/lib/nthlayer/store.db` (ensure dir exists and is writable) or chdir to a writable dir |
| 4 | `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` (persistent, not transient) | Two `nthlayer serve` processes on the same DB | Kill the duplicate; one writer per store. WAL + 5s busy-timeout handles transient contention, not two writers |
| 5 | `GET /manifests` returns `[]` despite `NTHLAYER_MANIFESTS_DIR` set | Relative path resolved from wrong cwd, or dir is empty/missing | Use an absolute path; check server logs for the load summary |
| 6 | One manifest missing from `GET /manifests` even though the file exists | Invalid YAML or schema mismatch; catalogue skips bad manifests rather than crashing the server | Check server logs for the parse error; fix the YAML; `POST /manifests/-/reload` |
| 7 | Local `curl` works, remote `curl` times out | Cloud firewall / security group / host firewall blocks 8000 | Open the port, or bind `--host 127.0.0.1` and SSH-tunnel |

#### 1. Command not found

`uv tool install` writes a shim to `~/.local/bin` (Linux/macOS) and
prints a warning if that directory is not on `PATH`. If you missed the
warning, `uv tool update-shell` edits your shell rc to add it; opening
a new terminal then resolves `nthlayer`. Verify with `which nthlayer`.
On macOS with zsh, a stale `~/.zshrc` cache or a non-login shell can
also hide the shim — `exec zsh -l` forces a re-read.

#### 2. Port in use

The exact error is `OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use` on
macOS and `[Errno 98]` on Linux. Confirm with `lsof -i :8000` (macOS)
or `ss -ltnp 'sport = :8000'` (Linux); the output names the process
holding the port. Either kill it or pass `--port 8001` (or any free
port) to `nthlayer serve`. Re-running a backgrounded server without
killing the prior process is the usual cause.

#### 3. Store path not writable

SQLite needs to create the database file and, in WAL mode, the
`-wal` and `-shm` sidecar files next to it. A relative
`NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH` (or the default `nthlayer.db`) resolves against
the server's cwd at startup; if that directory is read-only the open
fails on the first write request, not at startup. The failure surfaces
server-side as a structlog `core_store_error` event from
`_store_error_response` (server.py:33) with the SQLite message in the
log record; the client sees a generic `{"error": "internal_error"}`
500. Grep the server log for `core_store_error` to confirm. The fix
is to point `NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH` at a durable, writable absolute
path — `/var/lib/nthlayer/store.db` is the conventional choice for a
systemd unit (create the directory and chown it to the service user
first) — or chdir to a writable directory before `exec`. For a
quick unstick on a fresh install where you don't yet have
`/var/lib/nthlayer` provisioned, `NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH=/tmp/nthlayer.db`
works but does not survive reboot on distros where `/tmp` is tmpfs.
Container images that run as a non-root user need a writable volume
mounted at the store path.

#### 4. Database locked

The store opens with `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`,
`PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL`, and `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000`
(store.py:167–169). WAL allows concurrent readers alongside one
writer, and the 5s busy-timeout absorbs transient contention from a
single process's connection pool. A `database is locked` error that
persists past 5s indicates two writers on the same file — typically a
second `nthlayer serve` started against the same `NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH`.
Kill the duplicate; the single-writer invariant is load-bearing. A
stale `nthlayer.db-wal` file alone is not the cause and should not be
deleted while any process holds the database open.

#### 5. Manifests directory not loaded

On startup the catalogue logs `catalogue_loaded` with `count=` and
`directory=` (the resolved absolute path). If `count=0` and the
`directory=` path is not what you intended, the relative
`NTHLAYER_MANIFESTS_DIR` resolved against the wrong cwd. If the
log line is missing entirely, the path does not exist or is not a
directory — the catalogue silently treats this the same as unset
(catalogue.py:51) and `GET /manifests` returns `[]`. Use an absolute
path and confirm with `ls "$NTHLAYER_MANIFESTS_DIR"/*.y*ml`. Files
under nested subdirectories are also ignored.

#### 6. One manifest missing from the list

The catalogue wraps each file's parse in `try/except` and logs
`catalogue_load_failed` with `file=` and `error=` for the failure,
then continues with the rest (catalogue.py:121). The server stays
healthy and `GET /manifests` returns the manifests that did parse.
Grep the server log for `catalogue_load_failed` to find the offending
file and the parse error; fix the YAML and call
`POST /manifests/-/reload` to pick it up without a restart. A manifest
whose `name` field collides with another file's `name` will also
appear "missing" — the later file wins in load order.

#### 7. Remote curl times out

`nthlayer serve` binds to `0.0.0.0:8000` by default, so a local
`curl localhost:8000/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` even when
remote clients time out. The timeout (as opposed to a connection
refused) is the tell: the SYN is being dropped, not rejected, which
means a firewall — cloud provider security group, host `ufw`/`iptables`,
or a corporate egress filter — is blocking 8000 inbound. Open the
port for trusted CIDRs, or keep the server on `--host 127.0.0.1` and
reach it through an SSH tunnel (`ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 host`).
Binding to `0.0.0.0` on an internet-exposed host without authentication
is itself a hardening problem — see How-to: hardening for production.

#### Out of scope for this table

A few classes of failure are deliberately not covered here:

- **LLM provider keys, worker errors, judgment failures** — `nthlayer-core`
  has no LLM and no worker process; these surface only when workers
  are deployed. See `nthlayer-workers`.
- **TLS, reverse proxy, certificate renewal** — core speaks plain HTTP
  by design. See How-to: hardening for production below.
- **Authentication, authorization, rate limiting** — core has none in
  v1.5; the deployment is expected to terminate auth at a reverse
  proxy. See How-to: hardening for production below.

## How-to: hardening for production

Core in v1.5 ships zero authentication, single-process SQLite, and no
built-in backup. This how-to covers the one prod-hardening step with an
upstream-recommended pattern: durable storage via Litestream. Auth,
TLS, process supervision, and multi-region topology are deliberately
out of scope and pointed at your existing infrastructure — see "What
this guide does not cover" at the end.

### Durable storage with Litestream

> **Note.** This procedure is documented from upstream Litestream sources;
> end-to-end validation against real S3 storage is tracked in follow-up bead
> `opensrm-tu04.2.2`.

#### Why Litestream specifically

[Litestream](https://litestream.io) streams the SQLite write-ahead log
to S3-compatible object storage with no application changes: core
writes to SQLite normally and Litestream replicates the WAL underneath.
We recommend it because v1.5 core has no backup primitive of its own
and the WAL mode it already uses (`journal_mode=WAL` with
`synchronous=NORMAL`, see Troubleshooting row 4) is exactly the format
Litestream consumes. The canonical reference for configuration and
operational guidance is the upstream documentation at
<https://litestream.io>.

#### Process layout

`nthlayer serve` and `litestream replicate` run side-by-side, both
pointed at the same SQLite file (the path in `NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH`).
There are two patterns.

**Raw two-process.** Run each command in its own terminal or its own
systemd unit, both pointed at the same path:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (or systemd unit nthlayer-core.service)
NTHLAYER_STORE_PATH=/var/lib/nthlayer/store.db nthlayer serve

# Terminal 2 (or systemd unit nthlayer-litestream.service)
litestream replicate -config /etc/litestream.yml
```

**Wrapper.** Let Litestream supervise the serve process via `-exec`:

```bash
litestream replicate -config /etc/litestream.yml -exec "nthlayer serve"
```

The wrapper pattern is recommended: it gives single-process semantics
for your supervisor, and Litestream exits cleanly if either side dies,
so a process-supervisor restart re-establishes both halves together.

#### Minimal `litestream.yml`

The placeholders below are illustrative — substitute your own bucket,
region, endpoint, and credentials.

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/nthlayer/store.db
    replicas:
      - type: s3
        bucket: YOUR_BUCKET
        path: nthlayer-core
        endpoint: https://s3.amazonaws.com
        access-key-id: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
        secret-access-key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
```

The `path:` value matches the durable store path established in
Troubleshooting row 3. See Litestream's docs at <https://litestream.io>
for the full configuration schema, including non-S3 replica types and
retention tuning.

#### Restore procedure

To recover the database from the replica:

```bash
litestream restore -o /var/lib/nthlayer/store.db s3://YOUR_BUCKET/nthlayer-core
```

You would run this in two situations: cold-starting a new VM that has
no local store yet, or recovering from disk loss on the existing host.
The server must not be running while the restore is in progress —
Litestream and `nthlayer serve` both want to own the SQLite file, and
overlapping ownership corrupts the restore.

#### What this does NOT give you

- **Not HA.** The single-writer invariant is preserved; replicas are
  cold object-storage copies, not warm standbys ready to take writes.
- **Not point-in-time-with-zero-data-loss.** The recovery bound is the
  last replicated WAL frame — typically under a second of lag, but not
  zero. Writes acknowledged by core in the final sub-second before a
  crash may not be in the replica.
- **Not multi-writer.** Core remains the sole writer; Litestream does
  not enable horizontal scale or active-active topology.

If you need stronger guarantees than these, Litestream is not the right
tool and v1.5 core is not the right runtime — escalate to a
Postgres-backed v2 or a fully different storage layer.

#### What this guide does not cover

The following production topics are deliberate non-goals for this
guide, not future-TODO links:

- **Auth, TLS, reverse proxy** — front core with your existing gateway
  (Cloudflare, Caddy, nginx, ALB). Core speaks plain HTTP by design.
- **Process supervision (systemd / docker-compose / k8s)** — pick your
  platform's pattern. The wrapper form in "The two processes" above is
  supervisor-friendly: one process to supervise, clean exit on failure.
- **Multi-region / read replicas / HA** — out of scope for v1.5 core.
  The single-writer invariant precludes active-active.
- **Migrating an existing `nthlayer.db` into a Litestream-replicated
  setup** — out of scope for this bead; document when a real user
  asks.
